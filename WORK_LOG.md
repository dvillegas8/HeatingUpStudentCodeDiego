| April 5    |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| January 15 | 9:00 - 10:17  | During this time, I was discussing with Caden on how to approach this problem. On how we decided to approach this was we would create a paths array storing how long the paths are. We would go through every number and in another for loop we would look at all the temperatures before it. Once we found the longest path and a temperature that is lower than the current, we would add that length to the current temperature + 1. Therefore, I began coding this |

However, it seems that I couldn't pass the "testEfficientLarge" test case. Therefore, I decided to do some debugging. |

I tried using many methods, such as reseting the biggest path, keeping track of the index of the longest path. However, none would work |

Although not very efficient, it seems that this method worked and I was able to pass all of the test cases. |
